Official implementation for the paper "Cryptanalysis of Monoalphabetical Substitution Ciphers with Transformer Architectures". This repository contains code, models, and datasets for solving substitution ciphers using T5 transformer architectures.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview
This work explores transformer-based cryptanalysis of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using:
1. T5 models fine-tuned to predict plaintext or substitution alphabets
2. Correction models to refine outputs
3. Letter-frequency algorithms for final optimization

Achieves 91.96% accuracy on English texts. [Read the paper](paper_link_placeholder).
